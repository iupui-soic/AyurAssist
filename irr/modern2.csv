"25 year old healthcare professional develops fever, nausea andvomitting. 2 days later he has yellowing of urine. LFT showsraised enzymes beyond 2000 IU, total bilirubin 3.8. 
INR 1.07.Repeat LFT after 2 days bilirubin 6.8, SGPT 3700.2 months back he has H/O intake of PEP with Zidovudine,Lamivudine, Lopinavir, Ritonavir for 1 month.IgM anti Hep A positive.
",Acute hepatitis A ,"The pattern is classic for acute viral hepatitis A: abrupt febrile prodrome with nausea/vomiting, followed a few days later by dark urine and jaundice; aminotransferases often rise 10–100× ULN (into the thousands), and bilirubin increases after the enzyme peak, with INR often normal unless fulminant failure develops.

IgM anti‑HAV positivity in this acute timeframe is highly specific for recent HAV infection and is sufficient for diagnosis in a compatible clinical setting; hepatitis A is self‑limited and does not become chronic.

Drug‑induced liver injury from zidovudine, lamivudine, lopinavir/ritonavir is a recognized but relatively uncommon complication and usually appears during or soon after exposure; here PEP stopped about 2 months before, while a clear acute HAV marker is present, making DILI a much less likely primary cause.
