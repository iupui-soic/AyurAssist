Vidradhi is an inflammatory condition characterized by localized swelling; pain; and suppuration; often due to an imbalance of Pitta and Kapha; with Vata involvement in the formation and spread; **Antra-vriddhih ** – The **compressible gurgling mass** on palpation suggests a **hernial swelling**; **inguinal; epigastric**; which is classified as *Antra-vriddhih* in Ayurveda. This condition is primarily due to Vata imbalance; with a weakening of the abdominal wall and protrusion of internal contents; **Vata-Pitta Jwara** – The **acute infection** and **inflammatory process**  suggest a **febrile condition** with Vata and Pitta involvement. This is consistent with *Vata-Pitta Jwara*; where fever and inflammation are prominent; **Krimi Vyadhi** – The **chronic nature** of the swelling and the **inflammatory process** may also suggest a **parasitic; microbial involvement**; which is categorized under *Krimi Vyadhi* in Ayurveda. This is especially relevant in the context of a possible **cutaneous abscess**; **hernial sac infection**; **Granthi** – The **swelling** in the right lower chest area; though not clearly pathological in imaging; may be considered a **Granthi** (benign; inflammatory mass); which is often due to an imbalance of Kapha and Pitta; with Vata contributing to the formation and movement of the mass; **Vata Vyadhi** – The **gurgling mass** and **compressibility** are classic signs of **Vata imbalance**; which is central to the pathogenesis of hernias and chronic inflammatory conditions. Vata governs movement and structure; and its derangement leads to structural weaknesses and motility issues; **Mutrakshaya** – While not directly indicated by the case; the **elderly age** and **chronic nature** of the condition may suggest **renal involvement**; **dehydration**; which can contribute to the **inflammatory state** and **impaired immunity**; hence included as a supportive diagnosis; ---; **Note:** The **normal impression in the USG abdomen** and **absence of hepatic; bony lesions** suggest the pathology is likely **cutaneous; subcutaneous**; possibly involving **soft tissue infection**; **hernial sac inflammation**; which aligns with the Ayurvedic diagnosis of *Vidradhi* and *Antra-vriddhih*,vardhma; vidradhi; Apachi; vridhi,**Treatment:**; **Principles of Treatment:** - **Shamana Chikitsa**  for Vata-Pitta balance and inflammation control - **Shodhana Chikitsa**  via Panchakarma for systemic detox and immune support - **Vrana Chikitsa** for wound healing and abscess management - **Krimighna Chikitsa** for microbial infection control; **Formulations:** - **Vidradhi Shamana:** - **Gandhak Rasayan**  - **Kutajghan Vati**  - **Yashtimadhu**  - **Shatavari**; - **Vata-Pitta Shamana:** - **Ashwagandha**  - **Brahmi**  - **Shankhapushpi**; - **Hernia  Support:** - **Punarnava Mandur**  - **Chandraprabha Vati**; **Panchakarma :** - **Virechana**  for Pitta and Kapha imbalance - **Basti**  with Dashmoola Kwatha; Dashanga Ghrita for Vata balancing - **Shirodhara**; **Shirobasti**  - **Nasya** with **Anu Taila** for systemic detox and sinus support; **Dietary Advice :** - **Deepana-Pachana** diet: - Warm; easily digestible foods - Include **Trikatu**; **Ajwain**; **Cumin**; and **Ginger** for digestion - Avoid cold; raw; and heavy foods - **Hydration:** - Boiled and cooled water with pinch of salt and ginger - Buttermilk with cumin and coriander for Vata-Pitta balance - **Avoid:** - Spicy; oily; fermented; and sour foods - Alcohol and processed foods; **External Application :** - **Jatyadi Taila**; **Kumari Taila** for topical application on the abscess - **Sitopaladi Churna**; **Kutaj Taila** for local anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial action - **Wound dressing with Shatavari paste; Yashtimadhu** for healing; **Note:** Given the patient’s advanced age and presence of systemic infection markers (elevated ESR; neutrophils); **close monitoring** is essential.

In Ayurveda; obstructive respiratory conditions are often classified under *Shvasa Roga*; with subtypes based on dosha involvement. The chronic nature and dryness suggest a *Vataja Shvasa*; while the obstructive pattern and reduced air entry may also involve *Kaphaja Shvasa* due to mucus obstruction; airway narrowing; - **Shvasavahanadi Vata Vyadhi**: This refers to a disorder of the *shvasavahanadi* channels; indicating dysfunction in the airway system. The reduced air entry and hyperresonance on the left side suggest structural; functional impairment in the airway; consistent with obstructive lung disease; - **Jwara **: The patient has a low-grade fever for 15 days. In Ayurveda; fever  is often linked to *Agni* imbalance. Here; the fever is mild and likely due to a low metabolic fire; possibly secondary to chronic disease; systemic inflammation; - **Kanthagata Ama**: The presence of a dry cough and chronic obstructive symptoms suggests accumulation of *Ama*  in the throat and airway channels; which can obstruct normal respiration and contribute to inflammation; - **Vyana Vata Prakopa**: The dryness; reduced air entry; and hyperresonance suggest a disturbance in *Vyana Vata*; which governs the movement of air and circulation in the body. Its imbalance can lead to airway obstruction and impaired respiratory function; - **Shvasana Dushti**: Direct reference to dysfunction in the respiratory system; consistent with obstructive lung disease; - **Shvasavahanadi Vata Pramana Kshaya**: Indicates a depletion; imbalance in the *Vata* responsible for carrying air through the respiratory tract; leading to impaired breathing and structural lung changes such as pneumothorax; emphysema; This diagnosis integrates classical Ayurvedic concepts with the modern clinical picture of COPD; pneumothorax; and lung cancer; emphasizing the role of Vata and Kapha in respiratory dysfunction,Urashoola; kasa; Vataja Shwasa; swasa; Tamaka swasa; jwara,**Treatment:**; **Principles of Treatment:** - **Shamana Chikitsa ** for Vata and Kapha imbalance; especially targeting *Vyana Vata*; *Shvasavahanadi Vata*; and *Kanthagata Ama*. - **Kapha Shamana** to reduce mucus obstruction and airway inflammation. - **Vata Shamana** to restore normal air movement and reduce dryness and obstruction. - **Agni Deepana** to address *Mandagni Jwara* and improve metabolism. - **Shodhana **: In later stages; if there is significant *Ama* accumulation; consider *Vamana*; *Virechana* under expert supervision; **Key Formulations:** - **Vata Shamana & Shvasa Shamana**: *Shankhapushpi*; *Brahmi*; *Ashwagandha*; *Shvetavati*; *Haridra Khandana* - **Kapha Shamana & Ama Pachana**: *Trikatu*; *Chitrakadi Vati*; *Dashamoola*; *Shunti*; *Pippali* - **Respiratory Support**: *Talishadi Taila*; *Shwasakarshana Taila*  - **Ama Nidana Chikitsa**: *Haritaki*; *Amalaki*; *Bibhitaki*  with *Pippali* for *Ama Pachana* - **Shvasa Support**: *Shwasakarshana Taila*; *Shwasakalpa Rasa*; *Sitopaladi Churna*; **Panchakarma :** - **Shirobasti** with *Ksheerabala Taila*; *Shwasakarshana Taila* to pacify *Vyana Vata* and improve respiratory function. - **Nasya** with *Shwasakarshana Taila*; *Sitopaladi Taila* to clear *Kanthagata Ama* and improve airway patency. - **Virechana**  under expert guidance if there is significant *Kapha* and *Ama* accumulation; **Dietary Advice :** - **Deepana-Pachana** diet: Light; warm; and easily digestible foods. - Include *Shunthi*; *Pippali*; *Hing*; and *Haritaki* in meals. - Avoid cold; heavy; and mucus-producing foods (dairy; bananas; curd). - Recommend *Guduchi* and *Amalaki* decoctions for immune support and *Agni* stimulation. - Encourage warm herbal teas with *Tulsi*; *Shunthi*; and *Pippali*; **Lifestyle & Adjuncts:** - **Pranayama** (e.g; *Bhastrika*; *Sheetali*) under guidance for respiratory support. - **Smoking cessation** is critical for long-term improvement. - **Agni Teekshan** therapies  to enhance *Agni* and metabolism; **Summary:** - **Shamana** therapy for *Vata*; *Kapha*; and *Ama*. - **Panchakarma** (Shirobasti; Nasya) for targeted respiratory support. - **Agni Deepana** and *Ama Pachana* to address *Mandagni Jwara*. - **Diet and lifestyle** to support respiratory health and systemic balance,Rasayana therapy; Pranayama after recovery; deepana pachana; Kantakari Avaleha; supportive Ayurvedic care post-stabilization: Vasavaleha; vatanulomana; Emergency modern management is primary; Talisadi Churna,12.766755104064941,
